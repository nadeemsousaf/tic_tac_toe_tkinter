-Program Description- 
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe program with a 3x3 grid. The user is automatically set to 'X' while their opponent plays as 'O'. 
The grid is visible in a Tkinter window, generated when the code is run. To see the grid, expand the aforementioned window, 
to place an 'X', click an empty box in the 3x3 grid. As per the Tic Tac Toe rules, pieces cannot be placed on top of one another, 
so you can place pieces until either the user or the opponent wins OR until a tie is reached. 
There is a button in the top right corner with the text "Quit Game", which can be used to terminate the program before a win/tie is reached. There is a button in the top left corner with the text "Restart Game", which can be used to reset the game at any time.

-Compilation and Running Instructions- 
To play a game, enter "python tic_tk.py" into the terminal and place pieces on the grid until the game is over 
or until the user wishes to quit the game.

-Notes-
Within the code of the program, the word "board" is used synonymously with the word "grid".
